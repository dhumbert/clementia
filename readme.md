# Codename "Clementia"

A web app based on the Laravel MVC framework, to enable easy creation and running of web acceptance tests. Still in very early stages.

## TODO
- Capture screenshot during test with PhantomJS
- Make sure user owns site (like Google does having them upload file?) to prevent DOS? Maybe a better way to prevent DOS...
